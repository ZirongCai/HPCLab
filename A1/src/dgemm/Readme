## Implementation 1
One needs to have `OPT=2` to test the Implementation 1.
Besides, M, N, BLOCK_SIZE, and ALIGNMENT need to be specified

## Implementation 2
One needs to have `OPT=1` to test the Implementation 2.
Besides, M, N, m_c, k_c, m_r, n_r, and ALIGNMENT need to be specified following these requirements:  
- K is a multiple number of k_c  
- M is a multiple number of m_c  
- m_c is a multiple number of m_r  
- N is a multiple number of n_r  

## Vectorization report

One can check optimization report by removing the comments in the 26
