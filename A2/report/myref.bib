  abstract = {We present the basic principles that underlie the high-performance implementation
    of the matrix-matrix multiplication that is part of the widely used GotoBLAS library.
      Design decisions are justified by successively refining a model of architectures with
      multilevel memories. A simple but effective algorithm for executing this operation
      results. Implementations on a broad selection of architectures are shown to achieve
      near-peak performance.},
