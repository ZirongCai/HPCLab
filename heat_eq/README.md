# Assignment 5

## Build report

The report is created using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). But a Makefile is provided to run the necessary command. 
So simply run `make report` in this folder and it will create the report.

Dependencies are Pandoc, Latex and [fvextra](https://ctan.org/pkg/fvextra).
 
## Folder structure

For assignment 5, the top directory only contains the Makefile, the readme and the report files.

- `figures` 
- `scripts` 
- `result_logs`
- `src`
